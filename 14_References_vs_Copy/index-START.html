    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[3] = 'Test';
    console.log(players, team2);

    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    console.log(person, captain);
    captain.age = 99;
    console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 19});
    console.log(person, captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    console.clear();
    const cap3 = {...person}; //The future is now. It works!
    cap3.age = 26;
    console.log(person, cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      name: 'wes',

    console.log(wes.social.twitter, dev2.social.twitter);
    dev2.social.twitter = 'Twitter string';
    console.log(wes.social.twitter, dev2.social.twitter);

    //NOTE** Console.log also prints as a reference, not as a copy. So if the value is changed after the console.log, the log will show the changed value
